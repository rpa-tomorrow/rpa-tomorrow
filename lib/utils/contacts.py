    Returns a dictionary containing three key-value pairs given a string list

    trying to resolve the names with known contacts. If one of the names is a
    valid email it will be added to the resulting email list directly.

    Returns a dictionary with the following key-value pairs:

        - uncertain: list of tuples containing the name and a list of
                     the candidates which share the same name. Should be used
                     in a follow-up to resolve the correct contact.
